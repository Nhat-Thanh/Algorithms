# Attending Workshops
Problem link: [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/attending-workshops/problem)

A student signed up for **n** workshops and wants to attend the maximum number of workshops where no two workshops overlap. You must do the following:

Implement **2** [structures](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/structures/):

1. struct Workshop having the following members:
    - The workshop's start time.
    - The workshop's duration.
    - The workshop's end time.

2. struct Available_Workshops having the following members:
    - An integer, **n** (the number of workshops the student signed up for).
    - An array of type Workshop array having size **n**.

Implement **2** [functions](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/functions/):

1. `Available_Workshops* initialize (int start_time[], int duration[], int n)`
    Creates an Available_Workshops object and initializes its elements using the elements in the **start_time[]** and **duration[]** parameters (both are of size **n**). Here, **start_time[i]** and **duration[i]** are the respective start time and duration for the **ith** workshop. This function must return a pointer to an Available_Workshops object.

2. `int CalculateMaxWorkshops(Available_Workshops* ptr)`
    Returns the maximum number of workshops the student can attendâ€”without overlap. The next workshop cannot be attended until the previous workshop ends.

**Note**: An array of unknown size (**n**) should be declared as follows:
```
DataType* arrayName = new DataType[n];
```
**Input Format**

Input from stdin is handled by the locked code in the editor; you simply need to write your functions to meet the specifications of the problem statement above.

**Constraints**
- **1 <= N <= 10^5** 
- **0 <= start_time[i] <= 10^3**
- **0 <= duration[i] <= 10^3**

**Output Format**

Output to stdout is handled for you.

Your initialize function must return a pointer to an Available_Workshops object.
Your CalculateMaxWorkshops function must return maximum number of non-overlapping workshops the student can attend.

**Sample Input**
```
6
1 3 0 5 5 8
1 1 6 2 4 1
```
**Sample Output**

CalculateMaxWorkshops should return **4**.

**Explanation**

The first line denotes **n**, the number of workshops.
The next line contains **n** space-separated integers where the integer is the workshop's start time.
The next line contains **n** space-separated integers where the integer is the

workshop's duration.

The student can attend the workshops **0, 1, 3** and **5** without overlap, so CalculateMaxWorkshops returns **4** to main (which then prints **4** to stdout).
